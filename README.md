# Nike Website Clone

This is a personal test project aimed at developing and enhancing my web development skills. The project is a clone of the Nike website, built using Tailwind CSS and React.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a learning tool for mastering modern web development technologies. By replicating the design and functionality of the Nike website, I aim to solidify my understanding of responsive design, component-based architecture, and state management in React.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used for interactivity and dynamic content.
- **HTML5**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of the web pages.

## Features

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the site looks good on all devices.
- Modular Components: Reusable UI components built with React.
- State Management: Efficient state handling within the application.
- Tailwind CSS Styling: Custom and responsive styles using Tailwind CSS.
